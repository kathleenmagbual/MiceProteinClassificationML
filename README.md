Predictive Modelling of Mice Protein Expression 

It explores various proteins and mouse classes. The objective of this study is to explore, generate insights,
and to identify which types of protein have more impact on the mouse classes, this is to further aide in applying an appropriate machine learning classifier to correctly predict each mouse class.

This dataset is specifically interesting because it consists of a mix of both categorical and continuous variables with a multiclass label (eight mouse classes) serves as our target variable.
These eight mouse classes are as follows: “c-CS-m”, “c-SC-m”, “t-SC-s”, “t-CS-m”, “c-SC-s”, “c-CS-s”, “t-SC-m”, and “t-CS-s”. 

The dataset was retrieved from this source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00342/ housed on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Specifically the dataset "Data_Cortex_Nuclear.xls" should be converted to a .csv file for proper uploading a total of 1080 rows and 82 columns (1 ID column, 77 protein features, the other 4 features are genotype, treatment, behavior, and target feature - class)

All data preparation and modelling were done in IPython or Jupyter Notebook (in Anaconda) 3.0 above.
